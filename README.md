# pi-gpt-fast-mode

A [pi](https://pi.dev) extension that controls OpenAI's **service tier** for
GPT-5.4 / GPT-5.5 from inside pi.

Unlike a simple on/off "fast mode", this lets you pick the tier:

- **`priority`** — faster, premium (the classic "fast mode")
- **`flex`** — cheaper, slower (economy)
- **`default`** — standard
- **`auto`** — let OpenAI choose

It shows the active tier in the TUI and hands the preference off to subagents
automatically.

## Install

```bash
pi install git:github.com/devwithpug/pi-gpt-fast-mode
```

Try it for a single run without installing:

```bash
pi -e git:github.com/devwithpug/pi-gpt-fast-mode
```

## Usage

```text
/fast            # toggle Fast Mode (uses the selected tier, default: priority)
/fast on         # enable
/fast off        # disable
/fast priority   # select the fast/premium tier and enable
/fast flex       # select the economy tier and enable
/fast default    # standard tier and enable
/fast auto       # let OpenAI choose, and enable
/fast status     # report current state and tier
```

Start pi with Fast Mode already requested (priority tier):

```bash
pi --fast
```

## How it behaves

The extension separates what you **want** from what is **applied**:

- **desired** — you asked for Fast Mode (`/fast`, `--fast`, or persisted config)
- **active** — desired **and** the current model is supported → requests get
  `service_tier: <tier>`

Switching to an unsupported model temporarily stops the request without losing
your preference or your selected tier. Switch back to a GPT-5.4/5.5 model and it
resumes.

## Subagents

Turn Fast Mode on once in your parent pi session, then launch subagents as
usual. The preference is exported as the `PI_GPT_FAST_MODE` environment variable
(`1` / `0`), which child pi processes inherit on startup. A subagent only sends
the tier request when it is also on a supported model.

To verify, ask a subagent to print `PI_GPT_FAST_MODE`; `1` means the preference
was handed off.

## Supported models

By default:

```json
[
  "openai/gpt-5.4",
  "openai/gpt-5.5",
  "openai-codex/gpt-5.4",
  "openai-codex/gpt-5.5"
]
```

Model keys must match pi's exact `provider/model` key.

## Configuration

Config files are resolved in this order (first that exists wins):

1. Project: `.pi/extensions/pi-gpt-fast-mode.json`
2. User: `~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-gpt-fast-mode/config.json`

```json
{
  "persist": false,
  "desired": false,
  "tier": "priority",
  "models": [
    "openai/gpt-5.4",
    "openai/gpt-5.5",
    "openai-codex/gpt-5.4",
    "openai-codex/gpt-5.5"
  ],
  "indicator": "status"
}
```

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `persist` | `false` | Remember the on/off choice and tier between pi runs. |
| `desired` | `false` | Saved preference (only honored when `persist` is `true`). |
| `tier` | `"priority"` | Service tier: `priority`, `flex`, `default`, or `auto`. |
| `models` | see above | Exact `provider/model` keys allowed to use Fast Mode. |
| `indicator` | `"status"` | TUI feedback: `status`, `widget`, or `off`. |

Fast Mode starts **disabled** and **session-only** by default. Set
`"persist": true` to remember your choice between runs.

## How it differs from similar extensions

The core mechanism — injecting `service_tier` via `before_provider_request` — is
necessarily the same as other OpenAI fast-mode extensions. This one adds:

- **Multi-tier control** (`priority` / `flex` / `default` / `auto`) instead of a
  single hardcoded `priority` toggle, so it doubles as an economy (`flex`)
  switch.
- A `/fast status` subcommand and a tier-aware TUI indicator.

## Troubleshooting

**I turned Fast Mode on but I don't see the indicator.**
Check that your current model is in `models`, and that `indicator` is not `off`.

**My choice isn't remembered after restart.**
Set `"persist": true` in your config.

**Does this guarantee faster responses?**
No. It requests a service tier when possible. Actual latency, availability, and
billing depend on OpenAI and your account. Not every model/account supports
every tier; OpenAI rejects unsupported tiers.
